# dial9 Analysis Toolkit

This skill provides the JavaScript modules for working with dial9 traces programmatically.

## What traces capture

dial9 traces capture the internal behavior of a Tokio async runtime:

- **Poll events**: Every time a worker thread polls a task future (start/end timestamps, task ID, spawn location)
- **Worker lifecycle**: Park/unpark events with CPU time and kernel scheduling wait
- **Queue depth**: Periodic samples of the global injection queue
- **Task lifecycle**: Spawn and terminate events with spawn location
- **Wake events**: Which task woke which other task, and on which worker
- **CPU samples**: Periodic stack traces from perf/eBPF, attached to the poll they occurred in
- **Scheduling samples**: Stack traces captured when the kernel deschedules a worker thread (shows blocking calls)
- **Clock sync**: Monotonic-to-wall-clock anchors for correlating with external logs
- **Span events**: Enter/exit events from `tracing` spans (`#[instrument]`), showing what happened inside each poll with field values and nesting

## Quick start

```bash
node scripts/analyze.js <trace.bin or directory>  # full diagnostic report
node scripts/analyze.js traces/ --sample 50       # quick overview of large directories
node scripts/analyze.js trace.bin --force          # ignore cached results
```

## Modules

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/analyze.js` | CLI entry point and `analyzeTraces()` aggregation function |
| `scripts/diagnose_setup.js` | Setup diagnostic: detects missing frame pointers, wake events, debug symbols, sched events |
| `scripts/trace_parser.js` | Binary parser: `parseTrace(path)` yields `ParsedTrace` objects |
| `scripts/trace_analysis.js` | Analysis functions: `buildWorkerSpans`, `attachCpuSamples`, etc. |
| `scripts/decode.js` | Low-level binary format decoder |

## Default workflow

1. Always run `analyzeTraces(path)` first for trace diagnosis. This automatically runs setup diagnostics first.
2. If setup diagnostics report issues (missing frame pointers, missing wake events, missing debug symbols), help the user fix those before diving into performance analysis.
3. Base initial findings on the aggregate result: long polls, worker spans, scheduling delays, CPU/off-CPU groups, queue depth, task lifecycle counts, and span summaries.
4. Then use `parseTrace()` or lower-level helpers only to confirm assumptions, inspect raw events, or follow a specific task/wake/span chronology.
5. When the aggregate pass flags a specific moment — a long poll, a queue spike, a latency outlier — stop averaging and zoom in: use `dial9-zoom-window` to reconstruct that instant, and `dial9-diagnose-long-poll` to root-cause *why* a poll was long (on-CPU work vs off-CPU wait, and who held it up even when no scheduling samples were captured).

## Setup diagnostic

The setup diagnostic (`diagnose_setup.js`) runs automatically as part of `analyze.js` and checks for common configuration issues:

| Check | Severity | Symptom |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `missing-frame-pointers` | critical | CPU stacks are 1–3 frames deep instead of 10+ |
| `missing-wake-events` | warning | Tasks spawned but no wake events recorded |
| `missing-debug-symbols` | warning | Stack addresses unresolved or no source locations |
| `no-scheduling-events` | info | No off-CPU samples (sched profiling not enabled) |

Run standalone:
```bash
node scripts/diagnose_setup.js <trace.bin or directory>
```

```javascript
const { analyzeTraces } = require('./scripts/analyze.js');
const result = await analyzeTraces('/path/to/traces/');
// result.longPolls, result.workerSpans, result.schedDelayHist, result.cpuGroups, result.spanStats
```

`analyzeTraces` works on a single file or a directory. It returns a single aggregated result object with everything you need for diagnosis. See the `dial9-trace-analysis` skill for the full return schema.

After the aggregate pass, use the low-level parser to confirm assumptions or inspect raw details that the aggregate result points at, such as specific tasks, custom filters, wake chains, or per-file chronology:

```javascript
const { parseTrace } = require('./scripts/trace_parser.js');
const trace = await parseTrace('/path/to/trace.bin');  // single file
// or iterate a directory:
for await (const trace of parseTrace('/path/to/traces/')) { ... }
```
